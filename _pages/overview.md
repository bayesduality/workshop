# Bayes-Duality Workshop

## June 15-27, Japan

{: style="text-align: justify" }

First workshop of the <a href= "https:/bayesduality.github.io">Bayes-duality project</a> to be held physically in Japan. This meeting main goal is to discuss long and short term goals while fostering collaboration among its attendees. It will also give the opportunity to share its members recent work, published or ongoing.
Members of the ML community will join to give talks and discuss with project members their work. 
The organizers hope is that this workshop leads to an increase in the impact and outreach of the project as well as helping members expand their networks.

The main goal is to discuss the long-term goals of the project, set some short-term goals, and foster collaborations among the attendees. The project members will also present their recent published work. Several invited speakers will give talks about related topics, and will also have discussions with members to understand their work and advise them. Overall, the hope is that the meeting will increase impact, outreach, and help us connect.

Part 1 and Part 3 features talks by several invited speakers. Part 2 focuses on talks by the three PIs of Bayes-duality and many brainstorming/discussion sessions. The groups of three PIs will share some of their recent works and, through discussion, we will come up with new ideas to shape the future of the Bayes-duality project. We also hope to figure out immediate projects that some of us could work together on in the near future.

This workshop is partially supported by the Bayes-Duality Project, JST CREST Grant Number JPMJCR2112: “A new Bayes-duality principle for adaptive, robust, and lifelong learning of AI systems”.
