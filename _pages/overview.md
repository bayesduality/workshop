{: style="text-align: justify" }


This is the first workshop of the <a href= "https:/bayesduality.github.io">Bayes-duality project</a>, to be held physically in Japan. The goal of this meeting is to discuss the long-term goals of the project, set short-term ones, while fostering collaborations among the attendees. It will also serve as an opportunity for the members to share recent work, both published and ongoing.
Members of the machine learning community have been invited to give talks on related topics and participate in discussions with members to understand their work and advise them. 
The organizers hope is that this workshop leads to an increase in the impact and outreach of the project as well as helping members expand their networks.
