The first workshop of the <a href= "https:/bayesduality.github.io">Bayes-duality project</a> to be held physically in Japan. This meeting main goal is to discuss long and short term goals while fostering collaboration among its attendees. It will also give the opportunity to share its members recent work, published or ongoing.
Members of the ML community will join to give talks and discuss with project members their work. 
The organizers hope is that this workshop leads to an increase in the impact and outreach of the project as well as helping members expand their networks.

Part 1 and Part 3 features talks by several invited speakers. Part 2 focuses on talks by the three PIs of Bayes-duality and many brainstorming/discussion sessions. The groups of three PIs will share some of their recent works and, through discussion, we will come up with new ideas to shape the future of the Bayes-duality project. We also hope to figure out immediate projects that some of us could work together on in the near future.

This workshop is partially supported by the Bayes-Duality Project, JST CREST Grant Number JPMJCR2112: “A new Bayes-duality principle for adaptive, robust, and lifelong learning of AI systems”.
