# Bayes-Duality Workshop

## June 15-27, Japan

{: style="text-align: justify" }

First workshop of the <a href= "https:/bayesduality.github.io">Bayes-duality project</a> to be held physically in Japan. This meeting main goal is to discuss long and short term goals while fostering collaboration among its attendees. It will also give the opportunity to share its members recent work, published or ongoing.
Members of the ML community will join to give talks and discuss with project members their work. 
The organizers hope is that this workshop leads to an increase in the impact and outreach of the project as well as helping members expand their networks.

## Program

The workshop will be held in-person from June 15 - 27 at both the <a href= "https://aip.riken.jp/access/">RIKEN AIP office in Nihombashi</a> and at <a href= "https://izusan.zen-hd.co.jp/access/">Izusan Learning Center</a>. 
Here is the tentative outline of the workshop <a href= "https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTv7VwrT44C8j5r1yeortvvbJJGGuUZCo0OGk69WYsF2ibvcp4OV7WkY1uRkDikjjX4kRuYFL47JYwA/pub">Program</a>. All times are in Japan Standard Time (JST).
